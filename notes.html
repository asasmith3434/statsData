    <h1>B1 and C1 DataStats Lab</h1>
  <h2> B1 </h2>
   <p> 
     <pre> var finalscore= function(picFinal)
    {
        var pic={};
        pic.pic1= picFinal.picture;
        pic.finalGrade= picFinal.FinalM*0.35+picFinal.GradeMean*0.2+picFinal.TestMean*0.3+picFinal.HWMean*0.15;
        return pic
        
    }
    
    var answer= list.map(finalscore);
    </pre>
   We made a function that creates an empty object called pic.  pic has the penguin picture stored into it first before having the variable finalGrade stored in as well.  The variable finalGrade is the penguins scores multiplied by there wheight and added up to give their final grade in the class.  The function then returns the object now complete with things inside.  Next the answer is made as a mapped version of the function calling on all the penguins from the classroom to fill out the function.

    <h2> C1 </h2>
    <p> 
      <pre>
        var averagegradequiz= function(penguin)
    {
        return penguin.quizes[0].grade;
    }
    
var asa= classroom.map(averagegradequiz);
var answer = d3.mean(asa)
</pre>
Here a function is made that returns the penguins quiz grade for their first quiz.  Then the classroom is mapped into the function to get all of the penguins first quiz grades.  That is then averaged to get all the penguins mean of their first quiz grade.
